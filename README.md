## Project Description
This challenge is to refactor the existing code in urban-octo-telegram to
meet the following requirements:

HTML</br>
-test on page links and correct errors if necessary</br>
-add 'alt' attributes for relevant images to make the site accessible</br>
-add appropriate page title</br>

CSS</br>
-consolidate css selectors where possible to avoid repeating code</br>
-inspect code to ensure it follows semantic structure</br>
-add comments to show different elements/sections of the page</br>
